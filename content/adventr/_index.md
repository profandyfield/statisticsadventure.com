The `adventr` package contains a series of interactive tutorials that teach {{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}} alongside chapters of this textbook. The tutorials are written using a package called [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/). Once a tutorial is running it's a bit like reading a book but with places where you can practice the R code that you have just been taught. The `adventr` package is free (as are all things {{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}}-related) and offered to support tutors and students using my textbook who want to learn {{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}}.
