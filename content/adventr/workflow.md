## Suggested workflow

The tutorials are self-contained (you practice code in code boxes) so you don't need to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) at the same time. However, to get the most from them I would recommend that you create an [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) project and within that open (and save) a new RMarkdown file each time to work through a tutorial. Within that Markdown file, replicate parts of the code from the tutorial (in code chunks) and use Markdown to write notes about what you have done, and to reflect on things that you have struggled with, or note useful tips to help you remember things. Basically, write a learning journal. This workflow has the advantage of not just teaching you the code that you need to do certain things, but also provides practice in using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) itself.

Here's a video explaining how I suggest you use the tutorials:
